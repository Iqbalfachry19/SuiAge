# SuiAge
## Project Description
SuiAge is a zero-knowledge (ZK) age verification protocol built on the Sui blockchain.

It allows users to prove that they are above a certain age threshold (e.g., 18+) without revealing their actual birthdate or any personal information.

By extracting the user's birth year from an identity document (such as Indonesiaâ€™s KTP), a zk-SNARK proof is generated off-chain and verified on-chain. This enables trustless and privacy-preserving access control for age-restricted content in dApps, games, and DeFi applications.

## SuiAgeNFT Integration

Once a user is verified, they can mint an NFT as proof of their verified age status using the companion NFT project:

ðŸ‘‰ [SuiAgeNFT GitHub Repository] (https://github.com/Iqbalfachry19/SuiAgeNFT)

This NFT acts as a credential on-chain, signaling that the user has passed the age verification check.
